Mochimo Project - Main Net Development Repository

SUMMARY: The Mochimo Crypto Engine Main Net code is a fully functional crypto currency network node with text-based wallet included.

RECOMMENDED HARDWARE/SOFTWARE: The included code is designed to be run on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-Bit Desktop, with at least 2 processor threads and 2GB of RAM.  At present the code is designed to function on NVIDIA GPUs, and so both gcc and nvcc installations are required.

INSTRUCTIONS: Basic usage instructions for compiling can be found in the mochi directory included in the package.  The code will compile without issue on most Linux-based gcc compatible machines with a 64-bit long.  However please be aware that developer support for troubleshooting will be restricted to those users running the recommended configuration. 

You must read and agree to the LICENSE.PDF file prior to running our code.
